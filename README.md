# LowRes Galaxy ZERO

LowRes Galaxy ZERO is an endless highscore space shooter game. Currently it's just a remake of my fantasy console game [LowRes Galaxy 2](https://lowresnx.inutilis.com/topic.php?id=5), but it's meant to be the base of a more advanced game.

It's mainly a playground for me to practice modern C++ and the Entity Component System (ECS) architecture.
